StackMonitor
=======

A very simple app which monitors StackOverflow for new questions containing tags you specify. 

Selecting a question marks it as viewed. Double-clicking a question opens it in your browser. Viewed questions can be hidden making it easier to see what's new.

No app key has been registered so we're heavily throttled and limit requests to once every 3 minutes. I may look into registering at some point as well as adding authentication.
